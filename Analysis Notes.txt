### **1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
Before diving into the analysis, you'll want to ensure the data is clean and ready for deeper insights.

#### **Questions to Answer:**
- **Are there any missing values in the dataset?**
  - Which columns have null values? How will you handle them? (e.g., imputation, removal)
  
- **Are there any duplicates in the dataset?**
  - Are there duplicate rows that should be removed to ensure the integrity of the analysis?

- **Are there any outliers or anomalies in key columns?**
  - Which values are outside the expected range (e.g., negative quantities or negative revenue)?

- **Are there any inconsistencies in categorical variables (e.g., spelling errors, mixed case)?**
  - How will you standardize the text data in columns like `name` or `channel`?

- **Are the data types for each column appropriate (e.g., date columns formatted as dates)?**
  - Do we need to convert columns like `occurred_at` to a proper datetime format?

- **What are the statistics for numeric columns (e.g., mean, standard deviation, min/max)?**
  - This will help identify any unexpected or inconsistent values.
