## Problem Statement
Parch & Posey, a growing B2B paper goods company, faces challenges in optimizing its business operations amidst increasing competition. The company does not clearly understand how its sales efforts, marketing channels, and regional performance impact overall profitability. With vast amounts of untapped data on customer accounts, orders, and web interactions, there is a pressing need to analyze this information to:

1. **`Regional Performance:`** Identify high-performing regions and underperforming areas.
2. **`Marketing Effectiveness:`** Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing channels in driving customer engagement.
3. **`Customer Behaviour:`** Understand customer purchasing behaviour to tailor sales strategies better.
